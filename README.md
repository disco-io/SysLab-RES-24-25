<h1> Color Quantization of CIFAR-10 Image Dataset for Image Classification using CNNs </h1>
<br>
<h2>TJHSST Computer Systems Research Lab with Dr. Selma Yilmaz </h2>
<br>
Applied vector quantization and Floyd-Steinberg dithering to reduce the computational load of image recognition.
Maintains high classification accuracy while improving efficiency.
Aiming to optimize neural network inputs for low-power devices like surveillance and thermal cameras.
Final result is a complete color-quantized version of CIFAR-10 with public licensing for use.

<h2> How to Run Code</h2>
<br>
After cloning and cd into the repository, run the CIFAR10-CNN.py and wait a few minutes for training to begin. 
<br>
Quit the program at any time to view training progress across epochs. To resume, run the python file again and follow instructions in the terminal.
